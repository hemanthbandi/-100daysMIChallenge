What is Classification?
Data needs to be classified for every aspect in Machine Learning. Whether you are working on classification problem or regression problem. 
some of the examples of classification:
  1. Whether received Email is spam or not?
  2. Whether student gets admission or not?
  3. Is it apple or banana?
Attributes is key in Machine Learning Problems. Let’s take Student admission as our example.
To get University Admission, Student dataset consists of different attributes like GRE score, IELTS score, TOEFL score, GPA, Certifications etc. 
Every dataset consists of both dependent and independent attributes.
What is Dependent and Independent Attributes?
Dependent Attributes are the variables that affect the outcome of the process. Independent attributes are the variables that has no impact on the outcome.
Types of Classification?
There are two types of classification I have seen in my learning. 
1.	Binary Classification
2.	Multi Classification
Most but not all of ML problems can be solved with binary classification.
Binary Classification:
Binary Classification is basically a Supervised Learning algorithm since the training data set is already labelled. 
Some typical Binary Classification Examples are:
	Credit Card Fraud Detection
	Positive or Negative
	Spam Detection
Some of the various paradigms that are used for learning Binary Classifier
	Support Vector Machine
	Neural Networks
	Bayesian Classification
 

Multi Classification:
Multi Classification means a classification task with more than 2 classes.
Multiclass classification makes the assumption that each sample is assigned to one and only one label
